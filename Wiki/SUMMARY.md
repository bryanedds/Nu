# Summary: GUI Composition Wiki Page

## What Was Created

A comprehensive wiki page titled **"GUI Composition, Layouts, and Justification"** that documents Nu's GUI composition system.

## File Contents

### 1. GUI-Composition,-Layouts,-and-Justification.md (352 lines)

A complete guide covering:

- **Overview** - Introduction to Nu's GUI composition system for both ImSim and MMCC
- **GUI Elements** - Panel, Button, Label/Text, ToggleButton, RadioButton
- **Layouts** (with examples for each):
  - **Manual Layout** - Manual positioning
  - **Flow Layout** - Sequential arrangement with directions (Rightward, Downward, Leftward, Upward) and limits (Parent, Unlimited, To)
  - **Dock Layout** - Edge-based positioning (Center, Top, Right, Bottom, Left)
  - **Grid Layout** - Structured grid arrangement with dimensions and flow options
- **Justification** - Text alignment:
  - **Justified** - Horizontal (Left, Center, Right) and Vertical (Top, Middle, Bottom)
  - **Unjustified** - Natural flow with optional wrapping
- **Layout Properties** - Layout, LayoutMargin, LayoutOrder, DockType, GridPosition
- **Practical Examples** - Three complete, working examples:
  1. Simple vertical menu with Flow layout
  2. Dialog with Grid layout
  3. Info panel with Dock layout
- **Tips and Best Practices** - Seven practical tips for GUI development
- **Related Topics** - Links to other relevant wiki pages
- **Source Code References** - Pointers to implementation files

### 2. Home.md (Updated)

Added a link to the new GUI composition page in the introductory material section, placed after "Display Resolution and Window Resizing" since both are UI-related topics.

### 3. README.md

Instructions for pushing the wiki files to the GitHub wiki repository, including:
- How to clone the wiki repo
- How to copy the files
- How to commit and push
- Expected URL for the new page

## Key Features

- **Based on actual code**: All examples are derived from real usage in Jump Box and ToyBox projects
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Documents all layout types and justification options
- **Practical examples**: Three complete, copy-pasteable code examples
- **Well-structured**: Clear hierarchy with sections, subsections, and code blocks
- **Cross-referenced**: Links to related wiki pages and source files

## How to Push to Wiki

```bash
# Clone the wiki repository
git clone https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu.wiki.git

# Copy the files
cp Wiki/GUI-Composition,-Layouts,-and-Justification.md Nu.wiki/
cp Wiki/Home.md Nu.wiki/

# Commit and push
cd Nu.wiki
git add .
git commit -m "Add GUI composition, layouts, and justification guide"
git push origin master
```

## Result

Once pushed, the page will be available at:
https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/wiki/GUI-Composition,-Layouts,-and-Justification

This provides Nu users with a comprehensive, centralized resource for understanding and using the GUI composition system, which was previously only documented through scattered examples in the codebase.

## Features

- A metaprogramming system based on symbolic expressions with the **Symbol** and **SymbolicConverter** types.
- A generalized serialization system based on the above and related types.
- A powerful and reusable scripting language, AMSL, with the types in the **Scripting** module.
- A purely functional, publisher-neutral event system with **EventSystem** and related types.
- The functional-reactive **Stream** and **Chain** monads for said event system.
- A purely functional dynamic property system called **Xtension**.
- A purely functional random number generator called **Rand**.
- The incredibly valuable **VSync** monad allowing the same program to be run in parallel or debugged sequentially.
- The fastest-known persistent hash map in F#, **VMap** - over twice as fast as Map, and 1/3 look-up speed of Dictionary!
- Fastest pure functional **UList**, **UMap**, and **USet** collections rivaling the speed of .NET List, Dictionary and HashSet.
- Innovative pure-functional wrappers for arbitrary impure objects, **KeyedCache** and **MutantCache**.
- So many extension primitives I couldn't hope to mention them all!

Prime is built with clean and modular **Abstract Data Type** programming style as presented here - https://vimeo.com/128464151

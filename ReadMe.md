So... just what is the **Nu Game Engine**?

*"The Nu Game Engine is the world's first practical functional 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine. Built in F#, it offers a declarative MVU-based API called MMCC (Model-Message-Command-Content). Additionally, we're now providing an even easier to learn ImGui-inspired API called 'ImNui'! Nu offers a path to a future where game developers are liberated from the snowballing complexity of overly-imperative game programming approaches. Nu's implementation has matured enough to prove both the efficacy and viability of functional and declarative programming in games. Nu currently utilizes SDL2, OpenGL, Aether 2D Physics, and Bullet 3D Physics."*

This repository hosts several projects, including -

- the 2D arcade game tutorial, ['Breakout MMCC'](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/tree/master/Projects/Breakout%20Mmcc).
- **NEW!** Breakout tutorial using the ImNui API, ['Breakout ImNui'](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/tree/master/Projects/Breakout%20ImNui).
- the 2D puzzle game tutorial, ['Twenty 48'](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/tree/master/Projects/Twenty%2048).
- the 2D action game tutorial, ['Blaze Vector'](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/tree/master/Projects/Blaze%20Vector).
- the 3D third-person game sample, ['Terra Firma'](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/tree/master/Projects/Terra%20Firma).
- the commercial game demo for ['Omni Blade'](https://github.com/bryanedds/Nu/tree/omni-blade/Projects/Omni%20Blade), full game available now here - https://store.steampowered.com/app/3089800/Omni_Blade/
